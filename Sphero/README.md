## What you need to use Sphero robots?

- 1 Sphero robot
- 1 charger

>[!IMPORTANT]
> Sphero robots will disconnect with your computer if they have low battery, so make sure to keep them always charged.


## How to quickly start with a Sphero Robot?

### First you must configure the set-up

1. Install the [Edu app](https://sphero.com/pages/apps) from the Sphero company website.
> [!WARNING]
> There is a web interface that can also do what the app does, but it not supports Ollie robot, and does not have sample code.

### Create and run your first program

2. Create a new javascript project and copy the code on the [sample code file](sample_code.js).

3. Click the button play to run the sample code.


>[!TIP]
> Explore and try the examples on the [Programming Wiki](https://sites.google.com/sphero.com/sphero-edu-javascript-wiki/getting-started?authuser=0) that Sphero Edu has available. Also, in the app theres a tab called **Sphero programs**, that has many examples on how to code sphero robots.
